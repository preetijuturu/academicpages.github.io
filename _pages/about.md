I am a fourth-year Public Policy (B.A) and Economics (B.A) student at the University of California, Riverside (UCR) pursuing concentrations in Health/Population Policy and Urban/Environmental Policy. Hailing from a small, unincorporated and planned town experiencing rapid development in the San Joaquin Valley, my lived experiences and observations have fostered my commitment to equity and social justice. 

My career aspirations branch out into research and academia. I am interested in work that is interdisciplinary in nature, focusing on health disparities, environmental (in)justice, transmissible diseases, and equitable community infrastructure. Specifically, I hope to conduct mixed methods research and study these broad topics through a holistic lens, assessing how socio-cultural and geo-political barriers influence access to equitable care, community conditions and/or health outcomes. 

Currently I am affiliated with the [UCR Center for Geospatial Sciences](https://spatial.ucr.edu/) and the [UCR Center for Health Disparities Research](https://healthdisparities.ucr.edu/), where I contribute to ongoing projects. Following the completion of my B.A. degrees, I hope to pursue a graduate education in public policy, community planning, public health and/or an interdisciplinary social science field. 

I am also involved with grassroots advocacy efforts promoting disability justice and trans/non-binary healthcare access. I am passionate, diversely skilled, and highly motivated in whatever I partake in. Feel free to connect with me via [email](mailto:pjutu001@ucr.edu) or social media.
