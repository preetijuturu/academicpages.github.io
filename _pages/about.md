I am an M.S. student at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health's Department of Community Health Sciences, recently graduated with a dual-B.A. in Public Policy and Economics from the University of California, Riverside (UCR).

Hailing from a small, unincorporated and planned town experiencing rapid development in the San Joaquin Valley, my lived experiences and observations have fostered my commitment to equity and social justice. Moreover, my residence in the Inland Empire over the past 4 years has further solidified this passion and commitment. 

My career aspirations branch out into research and academia. I am interested in work that is interdisciplinary in nature, focusing on health disparities, environmental (in)justice, nutrition/food security, racial/ethnic health chronic health issues and equitable community infrastructure. Specifically, I hope to conduct mixed methods research and study these broad topics through a holistic lens, assessing how socio-cultural and geo-political barriers influence community conditions, health outcomes and/or access to resources. 

Presently, I am a summer Graduate Student Researcher (GSR) with the [UCLA Center for Health Policy Research](https://healthpolicy.ucla.edu/Pages/home.aspx), where I work on the Long-Term Services & Supports (LTSS) Study that focuses on increasing state and national data on individuals with disabilities and/or elderly individuals (65+) and their support systems.

I also work in collaboration with former colleagues and faculty based at UC Irvine, UC Riverside and San Diego State University on projects ranging from COVID-19 racial/ethnic disparities to harm reduction initiatives.

I am also involved with grassroots advocacy efforts promoting disability justice and trans/non-binary healthcare access. I am passionate, diversely skilled, and highly motivated in whatever I partake in. Feel free to connect with me via [email](mailto:pjutu001@ucr.edu) or social media.
