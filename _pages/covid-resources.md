### Project Overview

With the increased threat of the COVID-19 omicron variant and disparities in high quality PPE access, especially among communities in the Riverside/Inland Empire regions, my colleagues and I have established a grassroots initiative to fund, purchase and distribute masks from reliable vendors such as [Project N95](https://projectn95.org/) and [Bona Fide Masks](https://bonafidemasks.com/) to the UC Riverside campus community (students, staff and faculty). Currently, our team has been able to collect over $1000 in donations in purchase 800+ masks for campus distribution. In collaboration with the Associated Students of the University of California, Riverside (ASUCR), our team was also able to establish a COVID-19 Ad-Hoc Committee dedicated to COVID-19 affairs and issues on campus.

## Upcoming & Past Events

The ASUCR COVID-19 Ad-Hoc Committee has organized a COVID-19 PPE Distribution Event to provide free PPE kits to ALL students, faculty and staff at UC Riverside; we were able to secure 2,500 kits that include N95 masks, hand sanitizers and disinfectant wipes. This event will take place on *March 10th, 2022 from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM PST* at the UC Riverside Bell Tower.
